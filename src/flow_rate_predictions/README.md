## NYC Mobility Flow Predictions Based on Mobile Phone GPS Data

This repository focuses on mobility flows in NYC on a broader scale. Data is used from the following mobile lab sources:

Key graphics and results can be found in the 'FlowRateResults.pdf'.

The main goal of this directory was to study the change in flow rates of people within NYC pre and post Covid, as well as pre and post openning of Hudson Yards.
I also look at the impact of factors like census tract average income or number of jobs within the census tract to determine how income inequality may impact mobility rates from different census tracts in New York.
